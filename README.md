# Jhinlab Service

## About

Jhinlab connects Tibetans and Buddhist practitioners worldwide with monasteries across India and the Himalayan region, making sacred prayer services accessible to anyone, anywhere.

### The Problem

Many Tibetans living in Western countries maintain deep spiritual connections to monasteries but face significant barriers in requesting prayer services, butter lamp offerings, and pujas. Currently, they must rely on relatives or friends back home to physically visit monasteries, make donations, and relay prayer dedications—a process that is slow, inconvenient, and often unreliable.

### Our Solution

Jhinlab provides a direct digital bridge between devotees and monasteries. Users can:

- Browse and select monasteries by Buddhist sect, region, and location
- Choose from various spiritual services (prayer ceremonies, butter lamp offerings, special pujas)
- Make donations with personalized dedications and prayer intentions
- Track their service requests from submission through completion

Monasteries receive instant notifications via WhatsApp or SMS with complete service details, can acknowledge and manage requests through a simple dashboard, and receive payments directly—eliminating administrative complexity while maintaining the sacred nature of these traditions.

### Mission

More than a transaction platform, Jhinlab preserves and strengthens spiritual connections across borders and generations. We honor the sacred traditions of Tibetan Buddhism while making them accessible to the global community, ensuring that distance never separates devotees from their faith.
